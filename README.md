# Cool Notebooks

Welcome to my collection of Jupyter notebooks! This repository is a space where I document my personal studies, experiments, and explorations in Python, AI Applications and related technologies.

## 🧠 About These Notebooks

These notebooks reflect my learning process and include a variety of topics, such as:

- 📊 **Data Analysis** with Pandas and NumPy  
- 📈 **Data Visualization** using Matplotlib and Seaborn  
- 🧠 **Machine Learning** projects with Scikit-learn, XGBoost, and more  
- 🤖 **AI Agents** with frameworks like LangChain, Auto-GPT, or custom-built tools  
- ⚙️ **Automation Scripts** and productivity experiments  
- 🧪 **Python Prototypes** and library testing  

Each notebook is self-contained and includes explanations, code comments, and outputs to keep things clear and reproducible.
